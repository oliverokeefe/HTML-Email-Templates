# First udemy course
Going through the first udemy course on creating html emails. My work was following a walk
through to fill out course-files/myIndex.html (myIndex-localImg.html was what I made at first
before uplaoding the images to google photos for use in myIndex.html). The result is a page that looks almost
exactly like index.html.

The course also included using the template in gmail.
